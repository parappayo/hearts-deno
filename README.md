# hearts-deno

Lightweight front-end to accompany the parappayo/hearts-go backend.

For this project I'm giving [Deno Fresh](https://fresh.deno.dev) a whirl.

## Usage

For local dev:

```
deno task dev
```

This project is only the frontend. In order for it to work, you need to run parappayo/hearts-go as a backend.
